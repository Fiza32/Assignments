//	 Differentiate between static and non-static variables?
	
	/* Static Variable */
	
	// 1. Static variables are declared using the 'static' keyword within a class
	
	// 2. There is only one copy of each static variable for the entire class.
	
	// 3. Static variables can be accessed using the class name or through an object of the class. 
	
	// 4. Static variables are initialized when the class is loaded into the memory.
	
	
	/* Non-static Variable */
	
	// 1. Non-static variables are declared without the 'static' keyword
	
	// 2. Each instance has its own copy of non-static variables.
	
	// 3. Non-static variables can only be accessed through an object of that class.
	
	// 4. Non-static variables are initialized when an object of that class is created
